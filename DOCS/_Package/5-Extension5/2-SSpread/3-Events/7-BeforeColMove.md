| Number |   **_Col_**   | Column number of the column to move     |
| Number | **_ColDest_** | Column number of the destination column |

Example of usage

```
AllowColMove = $TRUE;
Function OnBeforeColMove (e) {
    MessageBox ( strf ("Move from% 1st column to % 2nd column ", e.Col , e.ColDest ));
}
```
