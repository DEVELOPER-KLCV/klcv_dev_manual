# {{ page.title }}

The string of the regular expression from which it was compiled.
This property is read-only.
 
**<small>In <a href="/package/system/regexpattern/#about-unicode-mode">Unicode mode</a>, you can specify a UString type string for the regular expression, but this property is fixed to the String type. Use the <a href="/package/system/regexpattern/methods/getpattern">GetPattern</a> method to get it as a UString type.</small>**
