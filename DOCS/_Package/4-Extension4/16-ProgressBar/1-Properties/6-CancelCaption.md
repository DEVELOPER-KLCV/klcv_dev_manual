# {{ page.title }}

Specifies the title of the cancel button of the window that is popped up by the <a href="/package/extension4/progressbar/methods/popup">Popup</a> method.
If nothing is specified, "Cancel" is displayed.

The cancel button is displayed when the first argument of the Popup method is set to $ TRUE.

If you change the value after the pop-up is displayed, it will be reflected on the screen by calling the <a href="/package/extension4/progressbar/methods/stepit">StepIt</a> method.
