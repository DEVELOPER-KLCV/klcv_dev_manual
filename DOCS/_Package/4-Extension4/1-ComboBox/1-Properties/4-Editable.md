Specifies whether to allow the user to enter any value.

If you specify $ TRUE, you can enter freely regardless of the choices defined by the ComboItem class, and if you specify $ FALSE, you cannot enter anything other than the choices.

However, if you set the Value property from the script, you can set any value without being affected by the Editable property.
