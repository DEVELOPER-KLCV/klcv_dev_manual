This event is generated by left-clicking on the cell corresponding to FlexTextBox. It does not occur on the icon that displays the list box.

The Clicked event has the following structure:

```
Event {
    FlexRow row; /* 移動した行をポイントするFlexRowオブジェクト */
}
```

The cell cursor can be referenced by the RowPosition property and ColumnPosition property, but since the event goes through the event queue, the row and col values of the Clicked event caught by the event handler will be the cell cursor at that point. It may be different from the position where it is located. Therefore, in order to manipulate the data at the position where the Clicked event occurred, be sure to specify the cell by the row and col of the event.
