Specifies the initial value of button activity on the cell.

The value of the Active property is used as the initial value of the activity to display in the cells of each row generated by the FlexView.InsertRow method. You can also change the activity of all existing rows at once by updating the Active property.

To change the activity of a particular cell, get the FlexRow object for the row you want to change and set the Active property of the FlexListBoxCell object that will be placed as a child object of FlexRow with the same name as the corresponding FlexListBox object.

If set to true, the button can be operated.
If set to false, button operations are prohibited.
