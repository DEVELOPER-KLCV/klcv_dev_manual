Specify the initial value of the icon to be displayed in the cell.

The value of the Icon property is used as the initial value for the icon to display in the cells of each row generated by the FlexView.InsertRow method. You can also change the cell icons in all existing rows at once by updating the Icon property.

The specified value is specified by the number starting from 0 in the ImegaList set by the setImage method, which icon is to be displayed.

To display a particular cell with a different icon, get the FlexRow object in the row you want to change and set the Icon property of the FlexLabelCell object that will be placed as a child object of FlexRow with the same name as the corresponding FlexLabel object.
