Specify the initial value of the text color of the cell. If the default value is $STD, the display color will be different for each class derived from FlexData.

The value of the FgColor property is used as the initial value for the text color of each cell generated by the FlexView.InsertRow method. You can also change the text color of cells in all existing rows at once by updating the FgColor property.

To update the value of a particular cell, get the FlexRow object in the row you want to change and set the FgColor property of the FlexCell object that will be placed as a child object of FlexRow with the same name as the FlexItem object in the column you want to change.
