# {{ page.title }}

Specify the initial value of the cell. Holds the value of the data type specified in <a href="/package/system/object/properties/valuetype">ValueType</a>.

The value of the Value property is used as the initial value for the cells in each row generated by the <a href="/package/extension4/flexview/flexview/methods/insertrow">FlexView.InsertRow</a> method. Note that the Value property itself is not displayed in the cell, but the copied value as the initial value of the cell.

By updating the Value property, you can update the values of cells in all existing rows at once.

To update the value of a particular cell, get the <a href="/package/extension4/flexview/flexrow">FlexRow</a>FlexRow object in the row you want to change and set the <a href="/package/extension4/flexview/flexdata/properties/value">Value</a> property of the <a href="/package/extension4/flexview/flexcell">FlexCell</a> object that will be placed as a child object of FlexRow with the same name as the FlexItem object in the column you want to change.
