Specify the initial value of the selected state of the check box.

The value of the Selected property is used as the initial value for the selected state of each cell generated by the FlexView.InsertRow method.

You can also update the cell values in all existing rows at once by updating the Selected property.

To update the value of a particular cell, get the FlexRow object in the row you want to change and set the Selected property of the FlexCell object that will be placed as a child object of FlexRow with the same name as the FlexItem object in the column you want to change.
