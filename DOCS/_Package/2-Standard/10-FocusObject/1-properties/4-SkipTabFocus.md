If $ TRUE is set, the focus will not be moved by the keyboard.

If $ FALSE is set, the focus will be moved by the keyboard.

 

By setting $ TRUE in the SkipTabFocus property with a button that has an auxiliary function, you can limit the focus movement by the keyboard only to the object that is the center of the input, and improve the efficiency of the input operation.
