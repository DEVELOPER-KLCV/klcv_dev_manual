If the keyboard focus is received, pressing the key specified in the NextTabKey property moves the keyboard focus to the next object.

 

If each class derived from FocusObject has its own key to be processed, keyboard focus movement will not be performed even if the specification is duplicated with that key.

 

For the values that can be specified for the NextTabKey property, refer to <a href="/base/key">Key specification</a>.

 

For the priority when multiple meanings are assigned to one key operation, refer to <a href="/base/key#priority-order-for-key-operations">Priority order for key operations</a>.
