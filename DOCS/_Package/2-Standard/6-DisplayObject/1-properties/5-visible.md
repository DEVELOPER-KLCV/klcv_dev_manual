Setting $ TRUE will display the object.

Objects are not displayed when $ FALSE is set.

Objects located below the object for which $ FALSE is set are also hidden at the same time.

If you change it to $ FALSE while it is in focus, the focus will move to the first object in that window that can receive focus.
