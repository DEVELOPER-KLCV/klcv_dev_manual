Specifies whether to allow or prohibit dialog resizing.

 

Setting $ TRUE allows the user to change the dialog size.

Setting $ FALSE prohibits the user from changing the dialog size. However, it can still be maximized and minimized. To prevent maximization and minimization and completely fix the dialog size, use the [MinimizeBox](/package/standard/dialog/properties/minimizebox) and [MaximizeBox](/package/standard/dialog/properties/maximizebox) properties.


The initial value is $ FALSE and the size cannot be changed.
