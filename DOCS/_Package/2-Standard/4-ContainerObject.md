A base class of a class that has a container function for arranging objects such as buttons and text boxes.

The ContainerObject class is a virtual class and cannot instantiate itself.

 

In the Mobile version, the ContainerObject class does not exist because there is no concept of class, but in the explanation of common properties and methods, it is explained as ContainerObject class for convenience .
