# {{ page.title }}


Specifies the horizontal scaling factor for objects that belong to the form.

The range is from 0.1 to 1 ( 1x ) to 10 .

This specification does not change the properties of the object on the form.

 

Objects that are scaled are not simply scaled, but each class has its own display.
