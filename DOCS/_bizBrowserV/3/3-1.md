Programming languages ​​usually have a well-defined unit of programming. For example , in the C ++ language, the center is a "class", and a set of classes is a program. In addition, the class may be described in multiple source files, or some may be linked by DLL. 

In the C ++ language, these source files and DLLs that make up a program cannot be compiled and, of course, cannot be executed unless they are completely complete. Many programming languages, not just the C ++ language, need to have all the components in place when they run their program.

In the CRS program, this situation is a little different. The CRS program is loaded by Biz / Browser , compiled into an intermediate language, and then started by the interpreter. 

At this time, it is not necessary to have all the elements that make up the program in advance, and execution will start sequentially from the loaded CRS program. The required components are dynamically assembled by the executed CRS program executing the CRS program load instruction [Get method](/package/system/netobject/methods/get) in the logic.

 In this way, the CRS program is dynamically loaded by the program logic and combined with the program running in the interpreter.
