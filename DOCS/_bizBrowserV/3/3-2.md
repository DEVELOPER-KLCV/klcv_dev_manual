CRS programs mainly consist of class definitions, object structure definitions and event handler function definitions.

Biz / Browser has many built-in classes. Each class defines its own functionality, for example the [Button](/package/standard/button) class defines its functionality as a button. You can also use the CRS program to derive existing classes and define new functionality.

Classes are grouped into units called packages, and all classes always belong to packages.
 
The object is created as an instance of the class. For example, an object of the Button class displays a button on the window. The CRS program configures the screen and defines the data structure by describing the structure in which these objects are created.

The event handler function is passed various events defined by the object. The event handler function describes how it behaves for those events. For example, describe the operation when the button is clicked.
