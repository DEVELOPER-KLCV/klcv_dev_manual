The CRS language is a scripting language dedicated to Biz / Browser.

The language specification is similar to JavaScript, and most of the statements and operators behave in the same way as JavaScript, so the knowledge that must be acquired when developing a Biz / Browser application is minimized.

However, it is not compatible with JavaScript (ECMA-262). Please note that copying the JavaScript written in the HTML does not work as expected.

The specifications have been greatly expanded in ver3.0, and many functions similar to JavaScript have been incorporated.

The specifications of classes and package functions have been expanded from ver4.0.

From ver4.1, the $$ symbol function that supports the construction of applications that support multiple languages has been added.

*<small>\*Mobile has adopted the CRS language specification equivalent to ver3.0.</small>* <br>
*<small>\*AI has adopted the CRS language specification equivalent to v5.0.</small>* <br>
