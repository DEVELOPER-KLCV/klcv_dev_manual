From Biz / Browser XE (ver.4.1) , Biz / Browser Mobile ver.2.0 , and Biz / Browser AI ver 1.0 , it is a new license management method that manages licenses for each connection to the Web server.

 

In the license management method using [connection licenses](/bizBrowserV/4/4-5/#connection-license-mechanism) , the license is managed for each Webserveraccessed fromBiz / BrowserOnly the licensedwebserver can be accessed.

The connection license is registered by importing the [connection license certificate](/bizBrowserV/4/4-5/#connection-license-certificate) (XML file) into Biz / Browser . Place the connection license certificate on the Web server and distribute it to Biz / Browser on each client PC.

 

From Biz / Browser V (ver5.0) and Biz / Browser AI ver 1.0 , it has been extended so that you can specify the [security level](/bizBrowserV/2/2-9/) with the connection license certificate.


### Connection License Mechanism
This section describes the technical mechanism and usage of the connection license.


**<u>Connection License Overview</u>**<br>
Information on the Web server that can be connected is registered in the connection license . Biz / Browser only allows communication to the registered web server.

A connection license is required for each server to connect to. A connection license to Server A is not available on Server B. Also, if the expiration date is specified, the connection license will be invalid after the indicated date.

**<u>Functions restricted by the presence or absence of a connection license</u>**<br>
Biz / Browser has many communication functions, but only http or https communication using the [Get](/package/system/netobject/methods/get) method of the NetObject class is restricted by the presence or absence of a connection license.

The [Login](/package/standard/root/methods/login) method of the Root class, [Get](/package/httppackage/httpsession/methods/get), [Post](/package/httppackage/httpsession/methods/post) method of the [HttpSession](/package/httppackage/httpsession/) class, import instruction, etc. communicate regardless of whether or not there is a connection license.

**Without a connection license** <br>

**Connection License Registration** <br>
The connection license is registered by importing the connection license certificate into Biz / Browser .


Place the connection [license certificate](/bizBrowserV/4/4-5/#connection-license-certificate) ( XML file) on the Web server and distribute it to Biz / Browser on each client PC . Download the connection license certificate from the CRS program with the [importConnectionLicense](/method/system/importConnectionLicense) function. If there is no problem with the description, the connection license will be registered.

The registered connection license certificate is saved on the client PC on which Biz / Browser is installed, and is automatically read the next time Biz / Browser is started.

In Biz / Browser V and later, the [security level](/bizBrowserV/2/2-9/) is stated on the connection license certificate . The security level of the certificate is applied when connecting to the web server. By using the connection license certificate, the security level of each client PC can be centrally managed on the server side.

 

**Connection License Confirmation** <br>
The registered connection license can be confirmed from the Biz / Browser menu "View"-> "Connection License Confirmation".

You can also check it with the [hasConnectionLicense](/method/system/hasConnectionLicense) function on the CRS program.


**General License Registration Flow** <br>
The system using Biz / Browser starts by calling the [Login](/package/standard/root/methods/login) method. (The Login method is also called when selecting the URL on the login screen)

```
//.Login ("http://server/start.crs");
```

Communication by the Login method is not restricted by the connection license. That is, the CRS file specified for this method can be run without restrictions. Normally, you write a program to register a connection license in this CRS file.

```
start.crs

/ * Check and import connection license * /
if (! hasConnectionLicense ("http: // server")) {
    try {
        importConnectionLicense ("http://server/license.xml");
    } catch (exp) {
        MessageBox (exp);
        Login ();
    }
}
Get ("appmain.crs");
```

The main CRS file of the system is called by the [Get](/package/system/netobject/methods/get) method of the NetObject class after confirming and registering the connection license.
