# {{ page.title }}

When Biz / Browser starts, it performs the following operations.<br>

**<u>Generating system objects</u>** <br> 
[Build a SYS object]() under the Root object . It is generated before the application's CRS is loaded and can be viewed at any time.


**<u>Loading the root handler</u>** <br> 
By default, the CRS file for the root handler is installed in the following location. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; C: \ Program Files \ AXIS SOFT \ BizBrowser \ settings.v41 \ default \ rootHandler.crs

If this CRS ( rootHandler.crs ) exists, get it in "//" ( Root object) with the [Get]() method.

rootHandler.crs is a script to display a pop-up menu equivalent to the system menu for right mouse clicks.


If you create an OnRClicked event handler on the Form directly under the root object , the root handler will not be able to receive the right-click event and the popup menu will not be displayed.

*<small>Does not run on AI & Mobile <br> This behavior has been abolished since Ver.5.0.0.</small>*

**<u>Loading initial screen</u>** <br>  *<small>Ver.5.0.0</small>*
The initial screen changes depending on the command line parameters and the installation status.

**When a URL is specified in the command line parameter**<br>
Get the specified URL to "//" ( Root object) with [Get]() method. This CRS file is not cached and is always downloaded from the server.

**If the URL is not specified in the command line parameters**<br>
Display the login screen. The login screen is created with a CRS script and is installed in the following location by default.<br>
```
Biz/BrowserXE C:\Program Files\AXIS SOFT\BizBrowser\settings.v41\default\login.crs
Biz/BrowserV  C:\Program Files\AXISSOFT\BizBrowserV\settings.v50\default\login.crs
Biz/BrowserAI /data/data/jp.co.axissoft.biz/files/assets/default/login.crs
```

If you have this CRS ( login.crs ), get it in "//" ( Root object) with the [Get]()  method.

If login.crs is not found, a login prompt dialog is displayed and the initialization operation is terminated.



**<u>Change loading screen</u>** *<small>Ver.5.0.0</small>*      <br>
From Biz / Browser V, it is possible to customize the "loading screen" that is displayed at startup or until the CRS is read by the [Login]() method. <br>

Set the value under the following registry.

&nbsp; &nbsp;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ SOFTWARE \ AXISSOFT \ BizBrowser \ 5.0 \ profiles \ 5.0.0 \ <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;( For 64bitOS , HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ SOFTWARE \ WOW6432Node \ AXISSOFT \ BizBrowser \ 5.0 \ profiles \ 5.0.0 \ )

***Display loading image***

You can display any image on the loading screen.


Use the image files, if any, in the following order:

(1) If LoginBG is set in the above-mentioned registry, the image file is used.

(2) If there are files named loading.bmp , loading.png , loading.jpg under <Biz / Browser installation folder > \ settings.v50 \ default , use those files.


If a loading image is specified, the progress of the loading screen will not be displayed. Only the background color specification (Login Base Color) is valid.

 
**<u>Output control of debug information (core dump)</u>**<br>
*<small>Added from Ver.5.0.2 and Mobile Ver.4.5.0</small>*  

If an unhandled exception is caught in the CRS execution engine while Biz / Browser is running , debug information ( core dump ) is output and processing is interrupted. 

From Biz / Browser V 5.0.2 and Biz / Browser Mobile 4.5.0 , you can control the output of this debug information ( core dump ) with command line parameters.

The format of the command line parameters is as follows.

**/ coreDump [n]** <br>

| Value 	| Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               	|
|:-----:	|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
|   0   	| Does not output debug information (core dump)                                                                                                                                                                                                                           	|
|   1   	| If an unhandled exception occurs, debug information (core dump) is output. If a core dump already exists, it will be overwritten. <br> (Equivalent to the operation of the conventional Biz / Browser)                                                                     	|
|   2   	| Debug information (core dump) is output every time an exception occurs, regardless of whether it is handled or not . The process ID and 4 -digit serial number are assigned to the core dump file name, and a new core dump is created each time a core dump is output. 	|

If omitted, 1 is assumed. <br>
*<small>With AI, it is possible to specify when creating a [shortcut]().</small>*  


**<u>Exclusive execution and URL movement specification in Mobile version</u>**<br>
*<small>Added from Ver.3.2.0 <br> This is a valid operation only for Mobile.</small>*  

In the Mobile version, multiple Biz / Browser Mobile cannot be started at the same time. If Biz / Browser Mobile is already running, when you start Biz / Browser Mobile anew, it activates the already started Biz / Browser Mobile and exits as it is.

 

If the /**force** option and URL are specified in the command line parameters, activate the already started Biz / Browser Mobile and forcibly move to the specified URL ( execute the login method ) .

 
**<u>Exclusive execution and URL movement specification in Android version</u>**<br>
*<small>This is a valid operation only for AI.</small>* 

In the Android version, multiple Biz / Browser AI cannot be started at the same time. If Biz / Browser AI is already running, it works as follows.

● If you tap the Biz / Browser AI icon to start it, activate the running Biz / Browser AI. <br>
● If you tap the shortcut of Biz / Browser AI with the specified login URL to start it, activate the already started Biz / Browser AI and forcibly move to the specified URL (execute the login method). 

 

 

This completes the startup process.
