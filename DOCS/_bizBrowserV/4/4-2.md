If you click a hyperlink to a CRS file in a web browser such as Internet Explorer or FireFox, the CRS file will be downloaded by your web browser and passed to you when you start Biz / Browser. <br>


{% assign img1 = "https://biz-collections.com/support/webpages/html/onlinemanual/browser/crs/init/init3.files/image001.gif" %}

<a href="{{ img1 }}" target="_blank"> <img src="{{ img1 }}" alt="{{img1}}"></a>


Biz / Browser cannot identify whether the file passed from the web browser is a file downloaded from the server or a file that was originally placed as a local file. As a result, the download destination cannot be specified , and access to the CRS file specified by the relative path cannot be performed correctly.


To avoid this behavior, when launching Biz / Browser from a web browser, you must explicitly tell Biz / Browser where to find the CRS file .

In the CRS file that the web browser downloads first, specify the URL that you should connect to and call the Login method. Biz / Browser will connect to the original URL immediately after loading the CRS passed from the web browser .
