This chapter describes the structural differences between the PC version and the Mobile version.


**<u>UserAgent Differences</u> <br>**
The User Agent at the time of request to the Web server differs between the PC version and the Mobile version.

Please be careful when the process is branched by UserAgent .

|          	| UserAgent          	|
|:--------:	|--------------------	|
| PC version     	| Biz/Browser        	|
| Mobile version 	| Biz/Browser Mobile 	|

**<u>SYS object</u> <br>**
The value of the SYS object is different.

|          	| SYS.CLIENT        	|
|:--------:	|--------------------	|
| PC version     	| Biz/Browser        	|
| Mobile version 	| Biz/Browser Mobile 	|

In addition, SYS.CLIENT_VERSION is also the version being executed, so be careful when branching the process with SYS.CLIENT, or when branching the process only by the version number.

**<u>Constant "$ MOBILE"</u> <br>**
In Biz / Browser Mobile, the constant $ MOBILE is set to 1 at runtime. By using this, it is possible to describe a hybrid CRS that branches the process from the previous version when executing CRS, ignores it when executing Biz / Browser for PC, and executes it only when executing Mobile.

**<u>root object, form object under root</u> <br>**
