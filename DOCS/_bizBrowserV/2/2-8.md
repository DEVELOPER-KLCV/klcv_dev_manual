**<u>Transferring gesture operations to higher-level Form</u>**

If you do not specify $ NOPARENTSCROLL for the Form. [UseGesture](/package/standard/form/properties/UseGesture) property , the gesture will be transferred to the upper Form. <br>
This allows you to scroll the Form above the gestureing Form by swiping.

On the contrary, in order to handle gestures in the operation target Form , it is necessary to specify $ NOPARENTSCROLL in the Form. [UseGesture](/package/standard/form/properties/UseGesture) property .
