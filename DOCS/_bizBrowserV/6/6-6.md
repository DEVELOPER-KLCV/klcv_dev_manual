# {{ page.title }}

In classes with arrayed child objects such as [ComboBox](/package/extension4/combobox/) and [ListView](/package/extension4/listview/), the [Clear](/package/system/object/methods/clear) and [ClearChild](/package/system/object/methods/clearchild) methods may not work as intended. This is because the Clear and ClearChild methods do not work on the element objects of the array.

 

For example, running the ComboBox.ClearChild method to initialize the list of ComboBox has no effect. Run the Clear method for each element.
